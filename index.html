                this is the reason why innumerable tourists are going to Sitakundo every day. Some are camping while
                others are trekking and coming back day after day. Sitakunda has gained more popularity as it is
                possible to return from Dhaka, Chittagong, Feni, Comilla or any other district in Bangladesh by day

                A traveler must stay for a few days to see all the sights of Sitakunda and its surroundings. If one
                starts the trail from Feni, it will take him 3 days to see the Boro komoldoho waterfalls, Choto
                komoldoho waterfalls, napittachara, khayachara, sahasradhara and suptadhara lasyamayi springs. Sitakunda
